## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a third-year software engineering student at Chapman University.
Currently working on [Interchange](https://interchange.bchen.dev), a fast, simple iPhone app for college transit.

Notable past projects:

- [Power to the People](https://github.com/brendan-ch/PowerToThePeople), an iPhone app designed to make traffic stops safer for marginalized communities
- [Sourcebook](https://github.com/brendan-ch/sourcebook), a lightweight content management system (CMS) designed to build class websites
- [Clockwise](https://github.com/brendan-ch/clockwise), a Pomodoro timer app designed to help you focus

Feel free to reach out if you have questions or want to collaborate!
